This is an [OpenUI](https://openui.com) Cloud project bootstrapped with [`openui-cli`](https://openui.com/docs/chat/quick-start).

## Setup

The CLI writes `.env` for you. If you cloned the generated project elsewhere,
run `pnpm generate:apiKey` to mint `THESYS_API_KEY`, then add `DEMO_USER_ID`
and `APP_ID`.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `src/app/api/chat/route.ts` and improving your agent
by adding system prompts or tools. A LangGraph scaffold puts the implementation in
`src/agent/agent.ts` instead.

## Deploy

From the project directory, deploy a preview with the pinned OpenUI CLI:

```bash
pnpm run deploy
pnpm run deploy -- --prod
```

When the project uses npm, replace `pnpm run` with `npm run` in both commands. The command deploys
to Vercel. Allowlisted keys from `.env` / `.env.local` (including `THESYS_API_KEY`) are
passed to that deployment unless you use `--skip-env`. Persist them on the Vercel project for later
deploys.

## Framework deployments

The Vercel AI SDK scaffold is a standard Next.js app: `streamText()` owns the
agent loop and UIMessage stream, so the whole project can be deployed to Vercel.

In both variants, your framework executes application tools. OpenUI Cloud
provides managed conversation storage and executes its provider tools: web
search, image search, and configured MCP servers.

## Conversation storage

OpenUI Cloud is the durable conversation store in every Cloud
variant. The browser connects directly through `useOpenuiCloudStorage()` with a
short-lived token from `/api/frontend-token`. For default, LangGraph, and
Vercel AI SDK routes, the `threadId` sent to `/api/chat` is the Cloud
conversation id, and the route appends each model turn to it with
`conversation: threadId` and `store: true`. The Eve overlay uses that same Cloud
thread store and maps each Cloud `threadId` to an Eve session cursor in the
browser; it does not use `/api/chat`.
Browser `localStorage` holds only the selected model (and, for Eve, the session
cursor), not conversation messages.

The Vercel AI SDK route does not create a second store. Add a LangGraph
checkpointer separately only if the graph needs durable state, interrupts, or
resumable runs.

## Switching Models

Use the model switcher in the chat header to choose a model for new messages. The starter keeps a
small curated model list in `src/lib/models.tsx` and sends the selected `provider/model` id to
`/api/chat`, which validates it against the same list. The built-in list includes Gemini, GPT,
Claude Sonnet, and Claude Opus options; free Gemini variants are marked with a `Free` badge.

The built-in model ids are available on [models.dev's OpenRouter provider
list](https://models.dev/providers/openrouter/).

## SDK packages

- `@openuidev/lang-core` — `generateSystemPrompt({ cloud: true })` used by the
  `/api/chat` route.
- `@openuidev/react-ui` — the chat UI runtime and component library
  (`AgentInterface`, `openuiLibrary`, `fetchLLM`, `ModelSwitcher`, storage/stream contracts).

A devtools widget is available automatically in development.
